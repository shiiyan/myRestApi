This is a RESTful API build on PHP framework `Phalcon 3.4.0`. 

It simulates stock management of an online store. 
A store manager can *add*, *search for*, *update* and *delete* products data and avatars using this API.

## Setup and Usage
1. After setting up MySQL server and Apache server, clone this repo to Apache server's `/htdocs` directory. 

2. Create a new database on MySQL server called, for example, `myproducts` and adjust the DI setting part of `index.php` according to what you have created.
```
[
  'host' => 'localhost',
  'username' => 'root',
  'password' => '',
  'dbname' => 'myproducts'
]
```
3. Create a new table on the database and name it `products`. Sample SQL query can be found in `materials/myproducts.sql`.
4. Start to use this API by sending HTTP request using `curl`.
